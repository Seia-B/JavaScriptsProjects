            The Sweet House in the Woods
            Once upon a time, two brave children named Hansel and Gretel lived at the edge of a great forest. Their family had fallen on hard times, and one day they found themselves lost deep in the woods.
            <br>
            As darkness fell, the children huddled together, hungry and afraid. But then, through the trees, they spotted something remarkable, a cottage that seemed to sparkle in the moonlight.
            Drawing closer, they gasped in wonder. The walls were made of gingerbread, the roof was tiled with chocolate bars, and the windows were panes of clear sugar candy. Unable to resist, they broke off small pieces to eat.
            <br>
            Suddenly, a crooked old woman appeared at the door. "Come in, come in, dear children," she called sweetly. But Gretel noticed something strange about her eyes, they were cold and hungry.
            The woman was actually a witch who trapped children. She locked Hansel in a cage and made Gretel work as her servant, planning to fatten up the boy for a terrible feast.

            But clever Gretel had a plan. When the witch bent over to check the oven, Gretel gave her a mighty shove. The witch tumbled inside, and the children quickly escaped, taking the witch's jewels to help their struggling family.
            <br>
            Following a trail of white pebbles Hansel had cleverly left behind, they found their way home. Their father wept with joy to see them safe, and with the treasure they'd brought, the family never went hungry again.
